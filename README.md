# MUJI

## Description ✨
This project is a redesing of MUJI's website. The aim of it, was to maintain the corporate identity of the brand but give it a fresher air and, at the same time, reduce the possible feeling of overwhelm that the user may experience when entering the original website because of receiving too much information.

* The home page
* The fanzine page
* The stationary section

## Technologies 📚

* HTML
* CSS
* SASS

* BEM methodology
