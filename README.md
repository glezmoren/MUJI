# MUJI

## Description ✨
This project is a redesing of MUJI's website. The aim of it was to maintain the corporate identity of the brand, give it a fresh air and, at the same time, reduce the possible feeling of overwhelm that the user may experience when entering the original website because of receiving too much information.
 
## Components 📁

For this redesing I recreated: 
* The home page
* The fanzine page
* The stationary section

## Technologies 📚

For this project I've used: 
* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* jQuery
* BEM methodology
